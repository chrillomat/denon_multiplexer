1. Install Prereqs:

- python2 (pacman -S python2)
- python twisted (pacman -S twisted)
- sudo (pacman -S sudo)

-----
1. You need to set up ssh to work without a password.

- Create ssh-keys for your user:
ssh-keygen

- Make these keys authorized to login to this machine:
cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys

- Verify that ssh'ing into the machine as works without a password works.

----
2. Set up Sudo. This is needed because we are not running ssh as root. If you
are ok with running it as root you could modify the denon_http file to remove
the 'sudo -u $LOCAL_USER' in from of the ssh command.

---
3. Copy the various files where they need to go:

rc.d/*       => /etc/rc.d/
conf.d/*     => /etc/conf.d/
denon_telnet => /home/<username>/denon_telnet (or a directory of your choice)

---
4. Modify the settings

- for the http proxy you need to set DENON_IP, LOCAL_PORT, and LOCAL_USER in
the /etc/conf.d/denon_http file. Note that if you set LOCAL_PORT to anything
besides 80 most programs that rely on talking to the Denon webserver as well
as the telnet port will fail.

- for telnet you need to set "remote_ip" in the denon_telnet.py file. I should
move this to its own config file as well

- you need to set the correct path to the denon_telnet.py file in
'/etc/rc.d/denon_telnet'

----
5. Test it out!

You should be able to start the two proxies with:
/etc/rc.d/denon_telnet start
/etc/rc.d/denon_http start

If you want these to run on boot modify /etc/rc.conf file to include them in the
list of daemons.

If you want to debug a Denon telnet program the telnet proxy also opens up a debug
port on 1357. You can telnet to this port to observe the traffic between the denon
and your program of interest.
